1. K-Nearest  
-Practices: Python string operations, K-nearest neighbor algorithm, Python Standard I/O.  
-Function: The program receives stream of files and within the files are sentences (words).  The frequency of the words are used to rank the files. Now with the ranked files sample files are compared and voted by the k nearest neighbor algorithm each sample files getting assigned to each of the original file's group. Also implemented stop words so that if certain set of words appear  in large amount universally across all files, it will be deemed stop word  and ignore in the process of ranking.     

2. Word-Vector  
-Practices: Python string operations, Vector operations, Python standard I/O,  Extraction of information from word patterns.  
-Functions: The program receives word to vector bin file(if required please inquire me,  I'll send the file (the file was too large to be stored in git).  The bin file contains a vector values of each vocabulary (For example the world "eat" will be assigned a value of 1101101000111 for each category).  Each vector values  represent some characteristic and each words will have different vector values.  
The program extracts each word vector from each words and user can choose different ways to analyze the words.  For example I outputted patterns where  
a word vector of a word minus another word vector of a word would equal to   another vector of a word (example: Eat-Sleep=Starve).  The Result.txt shows  these outputs.
